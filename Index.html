             <p>Your love life is going to be the same old mundane, don't fret. Praying may cost you some extra money, worth 2-3 meals maybe.
            Sun and Mercury  (we know, you don't know about any of it and can very easily be looped in by the mere mention of a planet name, so we put it) are crossing each other, so lets just roll with it and not cross the third street with 9 zebra crossing whites please.</p>

             <p>Creativity hardly has a standing in the corporate world, beware artists. Married folks, lets brush up the argumenting and logic skills, the time has arrived.
        Kids are cute.. hold them very close in case you need a sheild from the spouse's wrath. Keep the money safe, the prediction for frudsters is great this week (irrespective of their zodiacs). The markets are crashing for a reason, lets not end up suffering the Rose's fate  while praying hard to meet Twyla's. (Schitt's Creek is awesome).</p>

        Sneak out in the nights, young & old alike, your saturn depends on it(wink, wink). Before the final exam, prepare (Paid Partnership with parents across the nation). Google Ads don't pay enough &  judging us can affect Venus's position. (Watchout for them marks) </p>

            shifting its axis of rotation this week, your teachers are going to be supportive for the first time.
